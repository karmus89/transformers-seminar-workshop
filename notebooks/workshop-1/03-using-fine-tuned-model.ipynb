    "Let's recap here a bit. The thing to note here is that the output of our dataset must conform to what is expected by the BERT model. This needs to be taken into account especially when using the Hugging Face ``Trainer`` to train the model. From the documentation of the [BertFormMaskedLM.forward](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertForMaskedLM.forward) we can see that the model expects _at least_ the following arguments:\n",
    " - ``input_ids`` of shape ``[batch, sequence_length]`` (required)\n",
    " - ``attention`` of shape ``[batch, sequence_length]`` (optional)\n",
    " - ``token_type_ids`` of shape ``[batch, sequence_length]`` (optional)\n",
    " - ``labels`` of shape ``[batch, sequence_length]`` (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last one, ``labels``, the ``BertForMaskedLM`` model expects per-token labels but this time our labels are per-sentence. For sentence classification we will thus omit passing the per-sentence labels by design as our labels are per-sentence and not per-token. The per-sentence labels will be used with the separately defined classification head. For each batch of samples, the ``Trainer`` passes the data batched under each keyword as a separate keyword argument for the model's ``forward`` function. That is why the ``labels`` have still to be included in our samples."
